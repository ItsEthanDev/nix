# Pause Work

1. **Stop at a safe boundary.** Finish the current atomic action or leave it explicitly incomplete. Start no new task work. Stop any child agents or agent-owned background work; if a stop fails, report what remains active rather than claiming all work has stopped. Do not schedule or launch a continuation. Do not push, deploy, or take other irreversible action merely to make the pause tidy.
2. **Inspect the actual state.** Check the relevant workspace and Git status, including branch, uncommitted changes, and any work belonging to others. Record what changed, what was verified, and what remains uncertain. Do not commit incomplete or ambiguously scoped work just to checkpoint it; follow the repository's commit rules for already completed, verified work.
3. **Leave a resume note outside the conversation.** Use an existing work artifact if it owns the unfinished state and the request permits updating it. Otherwise write a short note to a temporary file on the current machine, outside the repository. If writing is not permitted, give the note in the reply and say that it is not persisted. Include the objective and scope, current boundary, decisions and evidence not already recorded elsewhere, exact paths to relevant artifacts, verification results and gaps, blockers or pending work, and the first concrete next action. Distinguish facts from assumptions. Refer to specs, commits, and diffs instead of copying them. Exclude secrets and unnecessary personal data. A temporary note is not a portable or permanent record; tell the user if a future agent cannot access it.
4. **Check the checkpoint.** Confirm the note exists and its references resolve where possible. Report its path, branch and dirty/clean state, outstanding work, and first resume action to the user. Say that any future continuation should read the note and recheck current repository state and authoritative sources. Then stop. Only the user initiates another agent or resumes work.

The checkpoint does not grant approval for new decisions or external actions.
